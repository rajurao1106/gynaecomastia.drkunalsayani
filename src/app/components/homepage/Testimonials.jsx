      "2 PRP session/3.5 months - pleased with the results: I got introduced to Dr. Sayani by one of my office colleagues. I was not sure to go for any hair treatment but after I met Dr. Sayani, he helped me understand how Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) process works and how much safe it is. As my colleague himself had positive resuts with Dr. Sayani, I decided to go for a few PRP sessions. Results are promising in a span of just 3.5 months. I am very pleased with how quickly we could get results. I was more than happy with services provided. I recommend Dr. Sayani for hairfall treatment.",

  //   fullReview:
  //     "I recently had the pleasure of working with Dr. Kunal, a plastic surgeon who skillfully stitched a cut over my 12-year-old daughters eyelid. Even myself being a doctor, I panicked that day looking at my daughters bleeding wound. After primary care, I started looking for some person who can take care of the wound in best cosmetic way as the cut was quite close to the eyelid. Dr Kunal was my rescue that day. I cannot thank him enough for his exceptional skills, good nature, and patient attitude during this difficult time. From the moment we arrived at his office, Dr. Kunal put us at ease with his calm and reassuring demeanor. He took the time to explain the procedure to us in detail and answered all of our questions with patience and kindness. It was clear that he genuinely cared about my daughters well-being and wanted to ensure the best possible outcome for her. Dr. Kunals expertise and precision were evident in the results of the surgery. The scar on my daughters eyelid is barely noticeable, thanks to his meticulous stitching and attention to detail. I am truly grateful for his exceptional work and the care he provided to my daughter. His staff is so warm and polite. I really want to take a minute to appreciate them genuinely. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kunal to anyone in need of a plastic surgeon for cosmetic scar treatment. His skills, good nature, and patient attitude make him a standout in his field. I am thankful that I contacted him on the day of the emergency, and I am confident that anyone who seeks his services will be in excellent hands. Thank you, Dr. Kunal, for your outstanding care and expertise.",

  //   fullReview:
  //     "Dr. Kunal Sayani is truly a gem of a person, very knowledgeable, dynamic. I had a huge tumor in my left breast, since many years, I couldnt express it to anyone. Booked an appointment and met Dr. Kunal, he was friendly, understood my state of mine, didnt judge me at all. He didnt judge me at all, was the reason I was all my heart open to him about my situation. He checked me throughly and guide me through the process, explained each and every aspect. Thankfully this tumor was benign, it was a giant fibroadenoma. All my reports were normal and he explained and discussed every small to small aspect very clearly about the surgery. November 30th 2024 was my surgery day. Dr. Kunal made me comfortable at every step, met me before the surgery, explained and did the markings on breast, and how he will conduct the surgery to me. Every instruction was crystal clear, I was not worried at all as I was in safe hands. After the surgery I was absolutely fit and fine, didnt even have the feeling of such a major surgery as Dr. Kunal Sayani handled it so well and smoothly. With minimum scars on my breast he did an excellent job. I am eternally grateful to Dr.Kunal Sayani for putting his best efforts not just for me, but for his every patient. Big salute to such doctors. After the surgery, every follow up was done on timely manner. Dr. Kunal Sayani is available for his patients 24√ó7 on call, personally comes to have a check on his patients after the surgery. I am really blessed to know him in person. Would 100% recommend anyone facing medical issues which is taken care by him, under his profile to once consult him without any hesitation. You will always be in safe hands. Thank you so much Dr. Kunal Sayani from the bottom of my heart, this surgery has changed my life in a very positive way. Cant thank you enough for all your efforts and excellent work. Keep doing the good work you always do and save the lives of people. Thanking you once again! üòä üôèüèª",
