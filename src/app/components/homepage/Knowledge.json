          "techniques": [
            "Liposuction: Ideal for cases with excess fatty tissue and good skin elasticity. Small incisions are made, and a cannula is used to suction out fat deposits.",
            "Excision: Necessary when glandular breast tissue or excess skin must be removed. Incisions are strategically placed to minimize visible scarring."

          "additionalInfo": "In some cases, a combination of liposuction and excision is utilized to achieve optimal results. Gynecomastia surgery performed by Dr. Kunal Sayani typically involves the following steps:",
          "steps": [
            "Anesthesia: The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia or intravenous sedation to ensure patient comfort.",
            "Incision and Access: Small incisions are made in inconspicuous areas such as around the areola or in the natural creases of the chest to minimize visible scarring.",
            "Tissue Removal: Excess glandular breast tissue and fat are carefully excised. In cases where fatty tissue predominates, liposuction may be employed to contour the chest and remove excess fat effectively.",
            "Chest Contouring: The surgeon sculpts the chest to restore a natural, masculine appearance with a flat and toned look.",
            "Closure: Incisions are closed with fine sutures to promote optimal healing and minimal scarring."

          "note": "The entire surgery is typically a day-care procedure, allowing patients to return home the same day. Dr. Kunal Sayani utilizes USFDA-approved, minimally invasive techniques designed to reduce pain and accelerate recovery, ensuring patients regain confidence quickly."
