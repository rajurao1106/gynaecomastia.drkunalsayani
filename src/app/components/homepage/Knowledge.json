        "description": [
          "FUE Technique: Dr. Kunal Sayani uses a specialized micro-punch tool (0.8-1.0mm in diameter) to meticulously extract individual follicular units (groups of 1-4 hair follicles) directly from the donor area. This method results in tiny, circular excisions that heal as almost undetectable dots, making it suitable for patients who prefer to wear their hair very short. The harvested grafts are carefully collected and preserved in a special solution to maintain their viability.",
          "FUT Technique (Strip Method): Dr. Kunal Sayani surgically removes a thin strip of scalp tissue containing healthy hair follicles from the donor area. The incision is then closed with sutures, resulting in a linear scar that is typically easily concealed by surrounding hair. Highly skilled technicians then meticulously dissect the strip under high-powered microscopes to separate it into individual follicular units. This method allows for the harvesting of a larger number of grafts in a single session, often with a higher yield of healthy grafts."

      "Folliculitis: Inflammation or infection of hair follicles, resembling pimples, which can usually be treated with antibiotics or warm compresses.",
      "Scarring: FUT: A linear scar in the donor area, which is usually thin and easily concealed by surrounding hair. In rare cases, it can be wider or more noticeable. FUE: Tiny, circular dot scars in the donor area, which are typically very difficult to detect, especially with shorter hair.",
      "'Shock Loss': Temporary shedding of existing hair around the transplanted area, which usually regrows. Transplanted hairs also shed before new growth begins.",
