    question: "What causes gynecomastia?",
    answer:
      "Gynecomastia is primarily caused by hormonal imbalances, especially an increase in estrogen or decrease in testosterone. It can also be linked to medications, medical conditions, obesity, or puberty.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is gynecomastia surgery suitable for me?",
    answer:
      "If you experience enlarged male breasts causing physical discomfort or emotional distress, and non-surgical treatments have been ineffective, you may be a candidate. A consultation with Dr. Sayani will determine the best course of action.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is gynecomastia surgery painful?",
    answer:
      "Some discomfort and swelling are normal after surgery but are typically well-controlled with medications. Most patients describe the pain as mild to moderate and manageable.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the surgery take?",
    answer:
      "The procedure usually lasts 1 to 2 hours, depending on the extent of tissue removal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will there be visible scars?",
    answer:
      "Incisions are made in discreet locations such as around the areola or chest folds to minimize visible scarring. Scars fade significantly over time with proper care.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is gynecomastia surgery permanent?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the removal of glandular tissue and fat is permanent. However, weight gain or hormonal changes can affect chest appearance later.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can gynecomastia recur after surgery?",
    answer:
      "While surgery removes existing excess tissue, maintaining a stable weight and avoiding substances that can cause hormonal imbalances helps prevent recurrence.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I return to normal activities after surgery?",
    answer:
      "Most patients return to non-strenuous work within a week and resume light exercise after 2-3 weeks. Full physical activity is usually permitted after 4â€“6 weeks, pending Dr. Sayani's evaluation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does gynecomastia surgery affect nipple sensation?",
    answer:
      "Temporary changes in nipple sensation are common but usually improve within months. Permanent changes are rare.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there non-surgical treatments for gynecomastia?",
    answer:
      "Mild cases may respond to medication or lifestyle changes, but surgery is the most effective and permanent solution for moderate to severe gynecomastia.",
  },
  
  {
    question: "Is the procedure covered by insurance?",
    answer:
      "Coverage varies by insurance provider and policy. If gynecomastia causes significant physical symptoms, some insurers may cover the procedure. It's advisable to consult your insurance company for specific information.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why choose Dr. Kunal Sayani for gynecomastia surgery?",
    answer:
      "Dr. Kunal Sayani is a highly experienced aesthetic and plastic surgeon with over 8 years of expertise in gynecomastia treatment. He uses advanced, minimally invasive techniques that ensure effective, safe, and natural-looking results, along with compassionate patient care throughout the treatment journey.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are common myths about gynecomastia?",
    answer:
      "Myth: Gynecomastia only affects overweight men. \n Fact: It can affect men of all body types due to hormonal imbalances or other causes.\n\n" +
      "Myth: Gynecomastia will go away on its own without treatment. \n Fact: Some cases resolve, especially in puberty, but many require surgery for permanent correction.\n\n" +
      "Myth: Gynecomastia surgery is very painful and requires long hospitalization. \n Fact: The surgery is minimally invasive with mild pain and usually done as a day procedure.\n\n" +
      "Myth: Gynecomastia surgery leaves large, noticeable scars. \n Fact: Scars are minimal and strategically placed to be inconspicuous.\n\n" +
      "Myth: Exercise alone can cure gynecomastia. \n Fact: Exercise can reduce fat but cannot remove glandular breast tissue causing gynecomastia.",
